# Fern
- fern project for Math en Jeans 2015 International Conference @ Avignon

- the fern evolves by a certain algorithm:
  - for each "generation", each point ("seed") creates 4 lines ("branches"): 1 up, then 2 symmetrical and inclined, then 1 up continuing from the center
  - the branches and seeds will evolve no matter what the angle is (by the current given data, it won't become facing down)

- for the code to work, you must install Cortona 3D Viewer, play with the values (commented), run the code, then open the file ("scenes.wrl")
  - it is best to open the file with Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge, as they have integrated support for Cortona 3D Viewer
  - to view the result, you must allow the content to be shown (Internet Explorer & Microsoft Edge & Mozilla use a pop-up)
