# Fern
- fern project for Math en Jeans 2015 International Conference @ Avignon

- the fern evolves by a certain algorithm:
  - for each "generation", each point ("seed") creates 4 lines ("branches"): 1 up, then 2 symmetrical and inclined, then 1 up continuing from the center
  - the branches and seeds will evolve no matter what the angle is (by the current given data, it won't become facing down)
